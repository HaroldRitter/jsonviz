# jsonviz

A Node.js module that converts JSON to DOT language and can create GraphViz graphics with viz.js.
The jsonviz module is not an abstraction level that makes UML creation very easier.
It is just a JSON format that describes dot graphs. That helps to create graphs
in a more intuitive way with JavaScript objects.
